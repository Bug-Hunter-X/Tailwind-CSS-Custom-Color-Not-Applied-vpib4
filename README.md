# Tailwind CSS Custom Color Not Applied

This repository demonstrates a common issue where custom colors defined in `tailwind.config.js` are not being picked up by Tailwind CSS, resulting in the custom color class not being applied in the HTML. The solution involves ensuring that the `content` property in the configuration file correctly includes all relevant files that use Tailwind CSS classes.
